			The Batik industry in Sri Lanka is a small sector of the Sri Lankan textile industry. During the latter half 
			of the 20th century, the Indonesian art of batik-making became firmly established in Sri Lanka. The technique
			was brought to Dutch Ceylon at the turn of the 19th century. It serves as a high-value export within the
			textile industry, and it is now a highly visible craft with galleries and factories, large and small, having 
			sprung up in many tourist areas.

		After nearly three hundred years since its Sri Lankan initiation, batik designs are being portrayed heavily in
		Sri Lankan fashion designs today. Made in silk and cotton, designed by leading fashion houses and produced by local 
		batik producers in Sri Lanka; batik clothes fetch extremely high prices in local and global markets. Local interior 
		designers are also maximizing the batik’s use of vibrant colours in producing unique lamp shades, linen, tapestry and
		upholstery to court the international attention. Under the direction of a group of innovative young designers, Sri Lankan
		batik designs are being rescued from the clutch of traditional clothing and summer wear and are being moulded into designs
		worthy of world’s leading catwalks portraying traditional mosaics of Sri Lanka.
