				Sri Lanka’s gem industry has a very long and colorful history. Sri Lanka was affectionately known as Ratna-Dweepa 
				which means Gem Island. Sri Lanka, geologically speaking is an extremely old country.  The mineralogy of the gem 
				deposits varies widely with, among others, corundum (sapphire, ruby), chrysoberyl, beryl, spinel, topaz, zircon, 
				tourmaline, garnet being common. Residual deposits are mainly found in flood plains of rivers and streams. The metamorphic
				types of gems constitute 90% of the gem deposits in Sri Lanka. It has been estimated that nearly 25% of the total land area
				of Sri Lanka is potentially gem-bearing, making Sri Lanka one of the countries with the highest density of 
				gem deposits compared to its landmass.
				Ratnapura contains the most gem deposits and derived its name from the gem industry. Ratnapura means “city of gems”.
